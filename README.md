Problem descriptions are on the [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com).  

* [Day 01: Sonar Sweep](day01.py) - rolling average
* [Day 02: Dive!](day02.py)
* [Day 03: Binary Diagnostic](day03.py) 
* [Day 04: Giant Squid](day04.ipynb) - Bingo
* [Day 05: Hydrothermal Venture](day05.ipynb)
* [Day 06: Lanternfish](day06.ipynb) - exponential growth
* [Day 07: The Treachery of Whales](day07.ipynb) - optimization problem
* [Day 08: Seven Segment Search](day08.ipynb) - deduce numbers based on inputs
* [Day 09: Smoke Basin](day09.ipynb) - find low points, brain hurt.  Hat tip to RojerGS for the clarified thinking on basin traversal

* [Day 16: Packet Decoder](day16.ipynb) - bitfield unpacking
* [Day 17: Trick Shot](day17.ipynb) - Like the old Apple ][ game
* [Day 18: Snailfish](day18.ipynb) - [[my, [brain,really]],[hurts,now]]
* [Day 19: Beacon Scanner](day19.ipynb) - Scanners and Beacons, lots of math
* [Day 20: Trench Map](day20.ipynb) - Enhancing image, rewrote as a class
* [Day 21: Dirac Dice](day21.ipynb) - Quantum / deterministic numbers
* [Day 22: Reactor ](day22.ipynb) - compression of coordinates
* [Day 23: Amphipod ](day23.ipynb) - I did this one via pen-and-paper.
* [Day 24: Arithmetic Logic Unit ](day24.ipynb) - always look inside the magic box.  There is an [Excel file](day24.xlsx) for analyzing the instruction set
* [Day 25: Sea Cucumbers](day25.ipynb) - similar to prior day
